ONLY AFTER WE GET CLEAN GSPO BASELINE:::
Yes. Do it next, after you lock a clean GSPO baseline.

**Why**
Your repo already does GSPO/GRPO on CA “principle induction” with deterministic tools and structured outputs (ECA rule numbers; Life B/S sets) on MLX. That’s a stable substrate. Add learning‑time circuit gating and, optionally, reflection‑to‑reward as orthogonal levers. ([GitHub][1])

**What to add, in order**

1. **Circuit‑gated GSPO (full‑param).** Per sequence, compute per‑layer saliency $S_\ell=\|\nabla_{\theta_\ell}\log p_\theta(y|x)\|_2^2\cdot \max(A,0)$. Keep top‑k% layers. Zero other grads before the optimizer step. This is masked backprop, not LoRA, and should reduce cross‑task interference. ([strangeloopcanon.github.io][2])
2. **Gated + EWC.** Snapshot Fisher diag over your training mix and add $\sum_i \tfrac{\lambda}{2}F_{ii}(\theta_i-\theta_{i,0})^2$ to protect shared skills.
3. **Reflection → Reward (optional).** On CA this only helps if you *pool evidence across multiple boards* and reward **consistency** of a hypothesized rule across diverse initial conditions. If you already supervise the exact rule ID per episode, reflection adds little.

**Concrete test plan (objective)**

* **Arms**

  1. GSPO baseline.
  2. GSPO + gradient‑gated updates (top‑k% by $S_\ell$).
  3. GSPO + activation‑gated updates (control; expect worse).
  4. 2. * EWC.
  5. GSPO + reflection‑consistency reward (only if rules are *not* directly supervised each step).

* **Data setups**

  * *Single‑rule per episode with ground‑truth rule label*: expect small deltas from reflection; gating should still reduce variance.
  * *Multi‑episode pooling without explicit labels*: reflection should help by enforcing cross‑board agreement.

* **Metrics**

  * **Sample‑efficiency**: AUC of reward vs tokens.
  * **Rule recovery**: exact rule ID accuracy (ECA) or B/S set accuracy (Life) on held‑out seeds.
  * **Generalization**: performance on longer rollouts and unseen densities.
  * **Interference**: train mixed ECA+Life; measure per‑domain deltas pre/post.
  * **Stability**: KL to reference, variance across seeds, % steps clipped.

* **Sweeps**

  * k ∈ {10, 20, 40}%.
  * Soft gating (scale non‑selected grads by α ∈ {0, 0.2, 0.5}).
  * GSPO knobs already in your runner: K, η, β, target‑KL, EMA‑ref. ([strangeloopcanon.github.io][2])

* **Where to wire it**

  * In your GSPO update path (see `rl/algo`), after computing sequence advantages and before the optimizer step, apply a per‑layer mask to gradients. MLX parity utilities expose a `loss_forward` and hooks; insert grad masking there. Keep reference‑policy KL exactly as is. ([strangeloopcanon.github.io][2])

**Expected outcomes**

* 2\) > baseline on sample‑efficiency and less interference.
* 4. trades a small speed hit for better retention.
* 3. underperforms 2), validating saliency over raw activation.
* 5. only helps when the rule is *latent* and must be inferred across evidence.

Net: this is a good, low‑confound next step on your repo. Add gating first. Add reflection only where labels don’t already give you the principle. ([GitHub][1])
